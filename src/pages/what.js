            One of the most distinguishing features of "web3" is the sheer level
            of handwaviness surrounding it. While you can find no end of press
            releases, crypto evangelists on Twitter, and venture capitalists
            extolling the virtues of web3, you will have a much harder time
            finding any definition that's not so full of buzzwords that it
            becomes meaningless. That's because "web3" is first and foremost a
            marketing term.

            Generally speaking, "web3" is an umbrella term to refer to the
            "future of the Internet", which believers say will be decentralized
            and based on the blockchain. Proponents tend to tout how data won't
            be controlled by "Big Tech", and how it will be uncensorable and
            egalitarian. There is, however, no shortage of examples in this
            timeline of how many "web3" projects are indeed centralized in
            similar ways to Big Tech, as well as instances where "uncensorable"
            or "unmodifiable" platforms have removed or modified data.

            Skeptics of web3 tend to point out that decentralization was a
            founding tenet of the Internet and is not something that is only (or
            best) achieved with a blockchain. They also tend to point out the
            enormous environmental impacts of blockchain technology
            (particularly{" "}

            blockchains, including Bitcoin and until recently Ethereum). They
            also often mention that an awful lot of web3 projects sound quite a

            , and question the lack of regulation, oversight, and taxation that
            makes fraud, tax evasion, and other criminal behavior particularly
            rampant in the space.
